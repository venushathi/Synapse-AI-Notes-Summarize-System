## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17 or later
* Apache Maven 3.8 or later
* MySQL Server (e.g., via XAMPP, WAMP, or standalone installation)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/synapse-ai-notes-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/synapse-ai-notes-app.git)
    cd synapse-ai-notes-app
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Database Setup:**
    * Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    * Open a MySQL client (like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or the command line).
    * Create a new, empty database. You can name it `synapse_ai_db`.
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE synapse_ai_db;
        ```

3.  **Configure `application.properties`:**
    
    **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This file is intentionally excluded from the repository to protect your secret keys. You must create it manually.

    * In the project, navigate to `src/main/resources/`.
    * Create a new file named `application.properties`.
    * Copy the content below into your new file and update the values for your local environment.

    ```properties
    # Server Port
    server.port=8080

    # Database Connection
    # Replace 'your_mysql_password' with your MySQL root password (or leave blank if none).
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/synapse_ai_db?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password

    # JPA and Hibernate Properties
    # 'update' will automatically create and update tables based on your @Entity classes.
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true

    # Hugging Face API Key
    # Replace with your own key from huggingface.co
    huggingface.api.key=YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Build and Run the Application:**
    * Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
    * Run the application using the Maven wrapper:
        ```sh
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
    * The application will start, and the necessary database tables will be created automatically. You can access it at **`http://localhost:8080`**.
